# Sirji>

> “Sirji” is everywhere. A fun jab among friends. A chuckle on the Zoom call. Much more than respect. It's our vibe.

Inspired by <a href="https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin" target="_blank">Devin</a>, Sirji is an initiative by <a href="https://truesparrow.com/" target="_blank">True Sparrow</a> to build an open-source AI software development agent that solves complex problems. It will automatically create a plan to solve the problem statement, prioritize it, organize research, write code, execute it, and fix issues.
