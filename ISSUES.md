# Reporting Issues

We appreciate your contributions to identifying issues and suggesting improvements to the Sirji VS Code Extension. This guide will help you in reporting issues you encounter.

## How to Report an Issue Effectively

1. **Navigate to the [Issues section](https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues) of the Sirji repository.**
2. **Click on the *New Issue* button** to create a new issue.
3. **Select a template** that best matches your issue type: "Bug report", "Enhancement" or "Other Question".
4. **Provide a concise and descriptive title** that clearly summarizes the issue.
5. **Fill out the issue template** with as much detail as you can. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for contributors to understand and address the issue:
    - **Describe the bug** or issue in detail.
    - **Steps to reproduce**: List the steps that lead to the problematic behavior.
    - **Expected behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen.
    - **Actual behavior**: Describe what actually happened.
    - **Screenshots**: If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your issue.
    - **Environment details**: Include any relevant details about your environment setup (VS Code version, operating system, extension version, etc.).
6. **Label your issue**, if possible. Common labels include `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question`.

## What Happens Next?

After you submit an issue, the maintainers will review it. They may ask for further details or suggest potential fixes. Keep an eye on your issue for any updates or requests for additional information.
